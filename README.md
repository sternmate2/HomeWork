# Hi and welcome to the BioData Test Repo

This is a short test to get a bit of insight on our future work together.

1. Clone the repo
2. Refactor the Dockerfiles to use docker best practices
3. Create a GHA to build and push the docker images to AWS ECR that can build in less than 3 minutes even with a large Gemfile and many dependencies
4. Bonus: create GTA static analysis that are recommended for Docker images


# The outcome
A PR to the repo with instructin about the setup required on AWS and Github to allow it to work.

# Some last notes
You are welcome to add in the PR some sample code that will make the docker build actually succeed :)

After the test we will have another short session to discuss the PR.
